# PRS Thesis Public Version

_This is a **public version** of our team thesis source code at Bach Khoa University, Vietnam. The reason we open this code is to allow the next generation of students who intend to improve the thesis can refer to. This source code was hidden private and sensitive information that we'd used during deployment._
