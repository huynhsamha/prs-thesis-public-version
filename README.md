# PRS Thesis Public Version

_This is a **public version** of our team thesis source code at Bach Khoa University, Vietnam. The reason we open this code is to allow the next generation of students who intend to improve the thesis can refer to. This source code was hidden private and sensitive information that we'd used during deployment._

## Quick start

### Source code

The source code is splitted to 4 folders, including `prs-server`, `prs-admin`, `prs-editor`, and `prs-audience`:

- `prs-server`: source code for Backend (API service)
- `prs-admin`: source code for Admin role
- `prs-editor`: source code for Editor role
- `prs-audience`: source code for Audience role

### What is PRS?

#### Definition

**PRS** is the abbreviation of *Personal Response System*. 

#### Motivation

The motivation of this thesis is to provide a system that

- supports *core features* of PRS
- makes a communication way between *Editor* and *Audience*, which is *reliable* and *transparent*.

#### Solution

We've researched Personal Response System and related products, after that we design and build a *core PRS system*. We've also applied **the blockchain technology** to our PRS system to resolve the second target we defined.

The detailed system architecture is written to our thesis report.
